# mod: A Lightweight Module System Compiler

## Module System

mod implements a basic, yet powerful module system inspired by ML-style modules. Here's a detailed explanation of the supported features and how our design accommodates them:

### 1. Modules

Modules in mod are first-class citizens and can contain:
- Value bindings
- Type definitions
- Nested modules

Example:
```sml
module Example = struct
  val x = 42
  type t = int
  module Inner = struct
    val y = x + 1
  end
end
```

Our design supports this through:
- The `module` datatype in `syntax.sml`, which can represent both module identifiers and structured modules.
- The `elaborate_module` function in `elaboration.sml`, which handles the elaboration of module structures and their bindings.

### 2. Signatures

Signatures describe the interface of modules, allowing for abstraction and information hiding. They can specify:
- Value types
- Type declarations (abstract or manifest)
- Nested module signatures

Example:
```sml
signature EXAMPLE = sig
  val x: int
  type t
  module Inner: sig
    val y: int
  end
end
```

Our design supports signatures through:
- The `signature` datatype in `syntax.sml`.
- The `elaborate_signature` function in `elaboration.sml`, which elaborates signatures into internal representations.

### 3. Module Type Checking

mod performs module type checking to ensure that modules match their declared signatures. This involves:
- Checking that all components specified in the signature are present in the module.
- Ensuring that the types of values and the definitions of types in the module are compatible with the signature.

This is primarily handled in the elaboration phase, where modules are checked against their signatures.

### 4. Transparency and Opacity

Our module system supports both transparent and opaque type definitions:
- Transparent: `type t = int`
- Opaque: `type t`

This is handled during elaboration, where type information is either propagated or abstracted based on the signature.

### 5. Path-dependent Types

mod supports path-dependent types, allowing references to types defined in other modules:

```sml
module M = struct
  type t = int
end

val x: M.t = 42
```

This is supported through:
- The `path` datatype in `syntax.sml`, which can represent nested module accesses.
- Path resolution in the elaboration phase, which resolves these references to their actual types.

### 6. Separate Compilation

While not explicitly implemented in this lightweight version, the design of mod is compatible with separate compilation. Modules can be defined and elaborated independently, with their interfaces (signatures) used for integration.

### Why Our Design Supports This Module System

1. **Flexible Syntax**: Our AST design in `syntax.sml` is expressive enough to represent complex module structures, signatures, and path-dependent references.

2. **Powerful Elaboration**: The elaboration phase (`elaboration.sml`) is designed to handle the complexities of module systems, including nested structures, signature matching, and type inference.

3. **Rich Internal Representation**: The `internal.sml` file defines semantic signatures (`semsig`) and structures (`struct_`) that can represent the elaborated form of modules and signatures, capturing all necessary type information.

4. **Environment Management**: The `env.sml` file provides a robust environment structure that can handle scoping of modules, types, and values, essential for managing the hierarchical nature of the module system.

5. **Separation of Concerns**: By separating the syntactic representation (`syntax.sml`) from the internal representation (`internal.sml`), we allow for a clean elaboration process that can perform necessary checks and transformations.

6. **Extensibility**: The design is modular and can be extended to support more advanced features like functors or higher-order modules without major restructuring.

This module system provides a solid foundation for organizing code, enabling abstraction, and supporting separate compilation. It strikes a balance between simplicity and power, making it suitable for educational purposes while still being practical for real-world use.
